# Resolution-independent rendering

The faithful renderer remains the indexed 320×200 visual oracle. The locked
historical sources, resource bytes, projection arithmetic and raster remain
authoritative. Host adaptations belong in `port/` and generated port overlays.

## Presentation contract

The grid aspect is 8:5; the intended physical display is 4:3. Pixels have 5:6
width:height. `port/render/viewport.h` fits a centred 4:3 rectangle inside the
actual SDL render-output size. It permits fractional scaling and downscaling;
nearest-neighbour sampling retains the indexed pixel art. The default window
is 960×720 and requests high pixel density. Mouse events are converted from
window coordinates to render-output pixels before applying the same rectangle's
inverse. Bars clamp to the logical edges. Minimized/zero-size surfaces map to
the origin. No game projection or framebuffer byte is changed.

`tests/test_sdl3_viewport.py` checks exact reference rectangles and every logical
pixel centre across 4:3, wide, portrait, fractional HiDPI and small outputs.
The existing framebuffer/F12 capture checks still exercise raw 320×200 pixels.

## Milestones

1. Correct faithful presentation and mouse mapping.
2. Record the ordered semantic stream at `polyinfo()` without bypassing the
   faithful rasterizer; compare it against the locked shape fixtures.
3. Render those commands with native output triangles and explicit 2D layers.
4. Carry recovered camera-space vertices into native projection.
5. Extend horizontal visibility around the central 4:3 composition.
6. Close special primitives, clipping and screen-space pattern semantics.
7. Validate historical equality, semantic fixtures and simulation equivalence.

Later milestone claims require executable evidence; this document does not
confer renderer acceptance.
